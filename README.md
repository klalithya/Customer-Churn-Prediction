# Customer-Churn-Prediction
Overview of the Project In order to forecast customer attrition, I applied five machine learning techniques to a telecom dataset: Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Logistic Regression.

Model Evaluation: To identify clients at high risk of churning, the most accurate model was chosen after analyzing and comparing the performance of different models. Creation of Insights: Telecommunications firms received actionable insights that gave them data-driven tactics to deal with client attrition based on likelihood percentages.
